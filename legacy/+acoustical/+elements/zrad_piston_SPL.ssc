% Obsolete - replaced by zrad_piston

% Approximate radiation impedance for a circular piston in an
% infinite baffle. The approximation is that given by Beranek
% in his Acoustics text, originally published in 1954. It is
% also include in the updated version of that book, entitled
% Acoustics: Sound Fields, Transducers and Vibration by Beranek
% and Mellow.
%
% This component also calculates the far field sound pressure
% level as a physical signal output. CAlculated pressure is in Pa.
