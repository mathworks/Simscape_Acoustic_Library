component cyl_orifice
% Small Cylindrical Orifice or Tube
% The component models a small orifice with a radius of "r" on a wall or baffle with a thickness "l".
% This can also represent a short length of tube. 
%
% The orifice is modeled as a mass-like component with viscous loss. The mass-like behavior is represented by an inductor
% and the viscous loss acts like a resistive component. The inductor and resistor are connected in series.
%
% The air mass inside the orifice is given by:
%
% Ma = (4/3)*œÅ*l/A
%
% Where œÅ is the density of the fluid and A is the orifice area.
% 4/3 accounts for the second order expansion, which includes 1/3 of the air spring mass, for better accuracy.
%
% The viscous loss of the orifice is given by:
%
% Ra = 8*œÄ*œÅ*ùúá*l/A^2
% Where ùúá is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
%
% If multiple orifices with the identical dimension are presented, divide Ma and Ra by the number of orifice N.
