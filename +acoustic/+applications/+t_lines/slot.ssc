component slot
% Small Rectangular Slot
% The component models a small rectangular slot with a width of "w", height "h" and thickness or length "l".
% The slot is modeled as a mass-like component with viscous loss. The mass-like behavior is represented by an inductor
% and the viscous loss acts like a resistive component. The inductor and resistor are connected in series.
%
% The air mass inside the slot is given by:
%
% Ma = 1.2*ρ*l/(w*h)
%
% Where ρ is the density of the fluid.
%
% The viscous loss of the orifice is given by:
%
% Ra = 12*ρ*𝜇*l/(w*h^3)
% Where 𝜇 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
%
% If multiple slots with the identical dimension are presented, divide Ma and Ra by the number of slot N.
